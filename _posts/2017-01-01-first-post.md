## A Little About Me

I'm a self taught developer living in Australia. I discovered I had a passion for computers when I got my first machine as a teenager. I attempted to teach myself C++ early on but I didn't get very far. After writing a few simple command line programs I decided I would try writing a windows application. I quickly became discouraged after realizing how much work it actually takes to create a windows interface in C++. This was my first, early experince with programming.

I had some fun adventures with computers in high school. After high school finished I decided I would study something I knew nothing about but still found interesting and that could provide me with a decent career. So I studied finance and pursued a career in banking. For a number of years this was a good career and I learnt a great deal. However, I decided I didn't really want to spend another decade or so in the industry. I went back to learning programming and shortly after got hired as a developer.

I've been working as a professional PHP programmer since then.

## About This Blog

This topic of this blog will be the Laravel framework and PHP. This may be followed by other topics I get intereseted in. I have my sights set on JavaScript and perhaps even Python and Data Science.

The direction I have planned for the blog is to document things I'm learning and write in a "how-to" format. This is at least initially and may change in the future.
