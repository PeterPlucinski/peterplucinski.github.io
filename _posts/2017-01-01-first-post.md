## About This Blog

So its the first day of a new year and I've decided its time to finally start this blog and tell the world a little about myself and what I'm up to.

The topic of this blog will be the Laravel framework and PHP. This may be followed by other topics I get intereseted in. I have my sights set on JavaScript and perhaps even Python and Data Science.

The direction I have planned for the blog is to document things I'm learning and write in a "how-to" format. The format and topic may change in the future.
